 Retrieval-augmented generation application in biomedical
we loaded the Mistral 7B model focusing on quantization for processing its trainable parameters for optimization
and developed a pipeline for processing biomedical and diet data, including efficient loading, chunking, and integration of large-scale datasets.
we also Implemented the FAISS index to significantly improve data retrieval, enabling the chatbot to access relevant information swiftly and accurately
we finally built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation chain, integrating retrieval-based and generative AI, to enable the chatbot to generate informed and accurate responses in the domain of biomedical and diet issues
